        Moodie is an open-source and self-hostable mood tracker with a plethora of features that work with and for you.
        It’s currently being developed by 2 software engineering students for a school project, but we plan on making it
        a fully-featured application.

        It’s privacy-oriented, secure, and incredibly easy to use, but don’t trust us, just follow me.
